# Timekeeping Policy
## Motivation  
It's important that Zetta employees document their time spent working on each project within the company.
There are two major reasons: 
1. Zetta receives government funding for some projects, and the funding agencies require documentation.
1. Documenting time helps us make plans to improve our processes.

For more details on requirements by funding agencies see this [website from the NIH](https://oamp.od.nih.gov/division-of-financial-advisory-services/indirect-cost-branch/indirect-cost-submission/time-and-effort-reporting-commercial-organizations). 
The nitty-gritty is actually in [2 CFR 200.430(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200/subpart-E/subject-group-ECFRed1f39f9b3d4e72/section-200.430#p-200.430(i)) and [45 CFR Part 75.430](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-A/part-75/subpart-E/subject-group-ECFR5d90ba314caea08/section-75.430).

## How to submit a timesheet 
By the 7th of the following month, each employee should submit a timesheet:
1. Make a copy of the [Timesheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GqPhTtK1WMgxrapQcUiCPusB-cxvvrWoe349hHDaJbQ) and place it within the [Timesheets directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GgGZ7WwGsp3rDH15Ga4vednjoaRyEk14?usp=sharing).
1. Rename the file as YYMM-Timesheet-Lastname-Firstname (e.g. 2209-Timesheet-Macrina-Thomas).
1. Update the first date (highlighted in blue) to the first date of the month for your submission.
The remaining column of dates will update to include only the weekdays of the month.
1. Update columns for the projects worked on, using codes from the [Project Codes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iYYhcvZOdradGXvS0aiQMKw8VYGLN0yvvOdCL00ZUaI/) sheet as headers.
Record hours worked for each project for each day, as well as any paid time off.

It may help to actively update the timesheet throughout the month.

### What about contractors?
Contractors are required to list their daily effort per project on their invoices.

## Validating timesheets  
A member of the Zetta admin team will verify timesheets by the end of the following month.
